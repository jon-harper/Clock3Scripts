# Clock 3 Scripts

This repository stores Fusion 360 scripts for the [Clock 3 project](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3).

## Installing

Where `{AddIns}` is your Fusion 360 "AddIns" folder:

```
cd {AddIns}
git clone https://jon-harper/Clock3Scripts Clock3Scripts
```

On Windows, this path is `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns`

## Usage

In Fusion, start the add-in. Your Solid Scripts toolbar will have a new group at the end with several utilities.

- The BOM Generator assists in creating a new Bill of Materials. See the main [Clock 3 repository](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3) for source data (in the `BOM` folder).
- Frame Tools works on the Master model to show just the frame and brackets, just the frame and tee nuts, or reveal everything.
- Other functionality will be added later.
